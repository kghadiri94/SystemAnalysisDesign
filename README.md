# SystemAnalysisDesign

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Driverpass was a company committed to better the education of new drivers to both learn how to drive and prepare for the test. The design they requested was to create a web-based system that will allow users to take online driving classes, online practice driving tests, and schedule in person appointments with driving instructors all from a singular location.

What did you do particularly well?
I understood the requirements and designed a system that incorporated all of the requests the company made.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my business requiremnts docuemnt and make it a little easier to read.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I understood exactly what the owner requested and it was a topic that was very relatable as I at one point had to prepare myself for the driving test. Although this was so many years ago, all of my preparation and practice tests were done in a book and the driving instructor had to be located seperately. Having access to a website like the one that was designed here would be a lot easier.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Although it is only a small part of every software, I like to focus on having an agile mindset, the ability for the software to be multi platform, and most importantly I like to make sure that the software is designed with great software security. It does not matter how well you do something, if the software is not secure it cannot be used.
